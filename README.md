# Can't Stop

A web implementation of the classic board game [Can't Stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can%27t_Stop_(board_game)), where players push their luck by rolling dice to advance up numbered columns. Includes a built-in probability calculator that shows the odds of each possible move.

## How It Works

Players roll four dice and split them into two pairs. Each pair's sum determines which column to advance. The catch: if you can't make a valid move, you lose all progress for that turn. The probability analyzer helps you understand the risk of each decision.
